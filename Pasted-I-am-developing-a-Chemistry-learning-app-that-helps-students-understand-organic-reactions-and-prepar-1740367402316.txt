I am developing a Chemistry learning app that helps students understand organic reactions and preparations interactively. The UI is built with Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. I want to enhance the app by adding more structured and detailed information on reactions and topics. Here’s how I want it to work:"

1️⃣ Functional Groups with Two Sections
When a functional group is selected from the dropdown, the UI should display two sections side by side:
Reactions (Transformation of the functional group)
Preparations (Ways to synthesize the functional group)
2️⃣ Dynamic Data Handling
Each functional group should have its own set of reactions and preparations, and the data should be fetched accordingly.
The UI should update in real-time when a different functional group is selected.
Example:
For Alkanes

Reactions Section:
Combustion
Halogenation
Cracking
Preparations Section:
From Alkenes
From Alkyl Halides
From Carboxylates
For Alkenes

Reactions Section:
Hydrogenation
Halogenation
Hydrohalogenation
Preparations Section:
From Alcohols
From Alkynes
From Dihalides
3️⃣ Detailed Information Display
Each reaction/preparation should have:

Name (e.g., Hydrogenation)
Description (e.g., "Addition of H₂ in presence of catalyst")
Equation (e.g., C₂H₄ + H₂ → C₂H₆)
Mechanism (if applicable)
Conditions (Temperature, Pressure, Catalyst, etc.)
Example Compounds
Data should be expandable with click-to-view details rather than basic alerts.

4️⃣ UI Enhancements for Better Learning Experience
Tabbed Interface – Each reaction/preparation should open in a tabbed format rather than a long list.
Searchable Topics – Users should be able to type keywords to filter reactions and preparations.
Clickable Equations – Show equations in a structured LaTeX/math format for better readability.
Dark Mode Support – Ensure that reaction equations and images are visible in both light and dark mode.
5️⃣ Additional Features
Integration of 3Dmol.js – Render molecular structures dynamically for reactions.
Video Explanations – Embed short tutorial videos for selected reactions/preparations.
AI-Powered Summaries – Allow users to generate quick AI explanations for any reaction.
Goal:
"I want my app to be an interactive chemistry learning tool where users can explore organic reactions and preparations in a structured, visually appealing, and dynamic way. Help me organize the reaction data correctly, ensure smooth UI transitions, and make it engaging for students.
